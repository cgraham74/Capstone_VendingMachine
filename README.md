# Capstone_VendingMachine
Capstone pair programming project.
A vending machine application that dispenses beverages, candy, chips, and gum. Each item has a name and price.
Main menu displays when the software runs. It is stocked via an input file and automatically restocked each time the application runs.
Customers can display items and quantity remaining including if a product has sold out. 
Customers can feed money and receive change in the smallest amount of coins possible and the balance is updated.
We used the greedy Algorithm to return change. 
We also incuded the optional sales output feature with unique file names.
